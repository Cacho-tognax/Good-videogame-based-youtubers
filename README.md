Focuses on looking at aspects that games schare from a game design prospect, while also covering specific games and how ther mechancis are designed, for a suggestion on a video to watch to get in his channel his video on [satisfactory](https://youtu.be/pO9HPW5uqBg) is neat , if you want something that focuses a bit more on game design concepts, here's one on [RNG](https://youtu.be/F5XM2DmUdmw) <br/><br/>
 
# Leonardo da Sidci
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJw2ZCRU1-dV5DZ4x3liOgot1YJIFFOQfBbY4Nrtlw=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

low only because he uploads and has uploaded very little and his last video had audio mixing problems, mostly focuses on how games feel and can make you feel, in a very soothing voice, altough one video I already posted had the pauses in speech annoyingly cut, for a better introduction I think this one on [depression and videogames](https://youtu.be/pIvcys_IPcQ) is great , or for something less scary, have this video on [the history of walking simulators](https://youtu.be/wl2zgLrfbTQ)
 
# Sseth Tzeentach

I don't believe if you tell me you don't know him, but if you don't he makes very humoristic reviews of various games, sometimes with NSFW themes and parts, I refuse to put a video in tho, I'm sure you know him, here mostly for completeness and it's the pursest form of review between the guys here, going in depth in exploits at most.

he talks about his impressions mostly, Not super in depth on design but his opinions are often interesting, have his [video on subnautica](https://youtu.be/-KJ9nJojIjA)
<br/><br/>
 
# Joseph Anderson
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJyzhyEPY59WdlpdTXbkW35d-6XhxxDd43M7v5TB=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

very long essays on some games, sometimes he gets stuck on details and may misinsterpet some things, but overall I really like his stuff and how in depth goes, have one video about [what remains of edith finch](https://youtu.be/6bMn4CoyUkM) as my suggested introductory one
<br/>

# RagnarRox
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJzkTPkoCNcy-Ess4f2VaTq0jbi2rtiByvDmAGwr=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

he's a digger of games, trying to give the spotlight to games that didn't get it, pointing out what makes the game he's talking about so unique and interesting, have one of his recent videos where he talks only about one game, going trough most of it, and the game in question is one of [photographing ghosts](https://youtu.be/_1A1br1FYrA).
 
# MadaloreGaming
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxGcxLajZTxgCXZCR8Lb9-K4S5G7a9yAmDBbsW39g=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

you probably know this one too, mostly a reviewer, covers games of various genres, he gets in some "game designer" segment since he sometimes talks on how he would have fixed a problem in the game, I think his most recent video on [the forest](https://youtu.be/YZb1dBMGN4k) gives an all around look at what he does 
 
# Civvie 11
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJynStEC1kmpt1-QT8qwPlCe-zRQFO46NrR9Gu47jA=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

this is more of an hard "commentated playtrough" he'll tell you what happens trought the game and what's like playing it, touching on how the mechanics feel, but nothing of the "developer point of view" I see many of the other suggestions here tackle, have this  most recent struggle of his as he plays [The Varginha Incident](https://youtu.be/YU0AWYGAeKI)
 
# Game Maker's Toolkit
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxd2kaIdXoBzfvzye2C9U4dQCCkkD3ZIC53CxLGSA=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

here we got hard game design stuff again, looking at either a game and what it can say about some design paradigm, or more rarely about how different games tackle the same "design challenge", have uhhh a bit unrelated but a talk about the conept of the [soulsike genre](https://youtu.be/Lx7BWayWu08), or if you are not a fan of it, let's go to an opposite and let's learn how to make [Super mario maker levels](https://youtu.be/Vwj3On5o58U)!
 
# Jacob Geller
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJwALL3GY1EF-X1VNSsimlg8HiJeOP9bbxrZAVIUDQ=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

nicely paced analysis and discussion on very broad topics about videogames, this last video of his about [writing on games](https://youtu.be/Vr6pA15xuFc) possibly partially inspired me in making this list and it's kinda about what I like about this kind of youtuber
<br/>
 
# Errant signal
<img align="left" style="padding-right:5px;" src="https://yt3.ggpht.com/a/AATXAJxMVLaQQ11DxmCVusalfCiS_yuGSOYBQ1Dj_6PP=s100-c-k-c0xffffffff-no-rj-mo">

`(Note: frequent spoilers with little warning)` he mostly talks about a single game but he often uses that to talk about a specific aspect of gaming as a whole, even if sometimes it's just all about how that game works, Let's start with a mildy political but very interesting one on [far cry 5](https://youtu.be/5EPqF_o4mCs), or an analyisis of what [the stanley parable](https://youtu.be/kiCLKmEAa1I) says.

The creator of the most excellent [freeman's mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQhfkpX9bc&list=PL6PNZBb6b9LvDWpI-5CPYUxG1Rnm-vr9V) and other such series, sometimes talks I guess mildly politcally about how things SHOULD be for the industry of videogames, including his belief that any game that relies on a cetral server should ensure it can be played after it shuts down or refund the consumers, but all of this comes from his passion and love for the whole thing, I love to see how deep he's willing to go for a game, have his game dungeon episode on [Baldies](https://youtu.be/nKK9r2Ct0D8), a game you probably don't know of but that will make you nostalgic if you started your gaming journey with dos games.

# Crowbcat

ok a bit of a tangent from the others, but his videos really make me feel, since it's just 3 minutes I say just watch his last(hopefully only for now) [video](https://youtu.be/3Q0nZDMOJ2I)
<br/><br/>

another I also love because he makes me feel sometimes with his videos, he makes mostly reviews but very in-depth ones analyzing how things go and sometimes even trying to emphatize with the devs for games that ended up bad. The quality of his writing is amazing managing to interwine seamlessy jokes and changes of subjects while keeping everyhting on topic. He recently resurfaced with anoter masterpiece so what the better way to start watchign him than his video, came out in 2020 about [the best games of 2017](https://youtu.be/5ebIizhEgxg), if you aren't at least in awe at him our friendship might be at risk.
